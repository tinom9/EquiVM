# Cat `bite(bytes32,address)` — EVM-side trace helpers

`catReachBiteRoutine` : from the `bite` arm entry (pc `375`) through the 2-arg `(bytes32,address)`
decode preamble and the unsigned length check (`need = 64`) to the `bite` routine entry at pc `1163`,
with the decoded args on the stack:
`[land ((1<<160)-1) (calldataWord 36), calldataWord 4, ⟨419⟩, catSelWord I]`.

Disassembly of the preamble (runtime.hex):
```

## Shared arithmetic routine: solc `checked_mul_uint256` @ pc `3720`

`bite` calls this DSMath checked-multiply routine 6× (inkSpot, artRateUnsafe, dunkRoomWad, inkDart,
dartRate, tabBase). Entry (after `PUSH2 ret; PUSH b; PUSH a; PUSH2 3720; JUMP`) is stack
`[a, b, ret, R]`; on the no-overflow success path it JUMPs to `ret` with `[a*b, R]`.

Disassembly (3720–3761):
```

```
The routine computes `UInt256.mul b a` (MUL of `[b, a]`); the caller relates it to its source-order
product by commutativity of `UInt256.mul`. -/

## Shared internal routine: solc `min` @ pc `3778`

These match the generic `solcCheckedSub/AddSuccessWf` shapes (both returning via the shared `3756`
trampoline), so `bite`'s `checkedSub "room"` and `checkedAdd "litterNew"` reuse the library lemmas.
The wrappers below specialize the PCs and discharge the `Wf`/jump-dest side goals. -/

## `vat.ilks(ilk)` STATICCALL @ pc `1248` (guard `1233`)

Completes the ilks call helper (`BiteCallIlks` only reaches the guard `1233`): steps the
`EXTCODESIZE` guard + `STATICCALL` and exposes the `typedCallViaEVM` coupling (`callCoincides`),
landing at pc `1249` with the success flag on top (the 5-word return decode that follows is
optimizer-interleaved with the urns calldata build, hand-traced in the main body).  Generic over the
deep stack tail `t`, the calldata memory `mem` and the argument list via `hencode`. -/

/-! ### Seg 6 memory layout

The solc `Ilk memory milk = ilks[ilk]` codegen first calls the 96-byte allocator `@3818` (bumps the
free pointer `fp := mem[0x40]` and zero-inits `[fp, fp+96)`), then hashes `keccak(ilk ‖ 1)` in the
`[0,64)` scratch and copies the three struct fields into a *second* fresh 96-byte region at
`q := mem[0x40]` (`= fp+96`).  `catBiteHelperMem`/`catBiteScratchMem`/`catBiteMilkMem` name the three
memory snapshots (allocator output, post-`keccak`-scratch, final `milk` region). -/

/-! ### Seg 6 helpers: abstract active-words invariance + zero memory-expansion cost

`Seg 6` keeps memory (`mem`) and active-words (`aw`) fully abstract, so — as in `Seg 2b`/`Seg 2c1` —
every `MSTORE`/`MLOAD`/`KECCAK256` needs its active-words-unchanged + zero-cost side goals.  These
are all consequences of two range bounds (`aw` already covers the `[0, fp+96)` scratch and the
`[q, q+96)` `milk` struct), packaged once here. -/

/-- **Seg 6** (`1620 → 1708`): `Ilk memory milk = ilks[ilk]` (allocate `@3818`, `keccak(ilk‖1)`, load
`flip`/`chop`/`dunk` into the fresh `[q, q+96)` struct) then `checkedSub "room" = box - litter` via
`@3762`.  The three struct fields land in memory (`catBiteMilkMem`); `room` reaches the stack.  `fp`
is the free pointer (`mem[0x40]`) and `q = fp + 96` the struct pointer; `hFp`/`hQ`/`hKec` are the
free-pointer reads + the `keccak` scratch read, `hawFp`/`hawQ` the active-words range bounds. -/

The `grab`/`fess` calldata is laid at the *fresh* free pointer `p = mem[0x40] = q+96`, whose region
is beyond the active-words high-water mark — so each `MSTORE` genuinely expands memory.  These helpers
package the two obligations that arise: (1) the successive active-words updates collapse to a single
`M` at the largest offset (`activeWords_expand32_collapse`), and (2) the free-pointer read at `[64,96)` survives all
the writes (`catBiteGrab*_read64`). -/


/-- Active-words after a size-32 memory op at offset `off`, kept **irreducible** so `isDefEq` treats
it as an atom (unfolding it exposes `M`'s `max`/`Div.div`/`if`, which blows up on the abstract free
pointer) — we `unfold` it only in the helper lemmas below. -/

/-- **`grab` calldata build** (`2073 → 2177`): marshal the 6-arg `vat.grab(...)` calldata into the
fresh free pointer `p = mem[0x40]` (7 `MSTORE`s at `p, p+4, …, p+164`; selector `0x7bab3f40`), leaving
the `EXTCODESIZE`/`CALL` frame that `RD.catBiteGrabCallGen` consumes at `2177`.  Because `[p, p+196)`
lies beyond the active-words high-water mark, each `MSTORE` genuinely expands memory (the active-words
are threaded `Cₘ awₖ − Cₘ awₖ₋₁`); `hFree64` pins the free pointer, `hawcov`/`hawsz`/`hpsz` bound it. -/
