/-! # Cat `bite` — the `p`-parametric `kick` trace reach (pc 2383 → RETURN)

The frozen kick trace (`catBiteTraceSeg8aCalldata`/`Seg8b1`/`Seg8b2`, and the wrappers
`catBiteReach2383to2532`/`catBiteReach2532toRet`) all bake `@0x40 = 128`, which is UNSATISFIABLE in
the real chained `bite` flow: the milk-struct build advances the free pointer to `q + 96 = 320`.
This file re-does the whole kick tail at the abstract free pointer `p` (the real one), cloning the
frozen RD steps but mapping every memory OFFSET `128 → p`, `132 → p+4`, `164 → p+36`, `196 → p+68`,
`228 → p+100`, `260 → p+132`, `292 → p+164` (and the event offsets `128 → p`, `160 → p+32`, …),
while LENGTHS (argsLen 164, retLen 32, word 32, log 160, selector 4) stay fixed.  The calldata memory
is the foundation def `kickCalldataMemP p …` (from `BiteBodyReach`). -/
