/-! ## `exit(uint256)` — checked subtraction routine (`_sub @2336`)

`exit` mirrors `join` but subtracts (`sub256`, underflow-revert) where `join` adds, and its
`vat.move(from,to,rad)` arguments are `(address(this), msg.sender)` — swapped vs `join`.  The whole
`853→CALL` calldata builder + post-`CALL` tails are shared bytecode with `join`; only the `from`/`to`
stack order (and hence the `potMoveCalldataMem` arguments) differ. -/

/-- `_sub(a, b)` routine (`@2336`): stack `[a, b, ret, R]` → `[b - a, R]` at `ret`, no underflow. -/
