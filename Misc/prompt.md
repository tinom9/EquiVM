# Agent prompt — proving EVM↔Solm correctness for a contract

You are proving that a concrete EVM bytecode artifact refines its Solm
specification. You goal is to complete the proof of the top-level theorem 
in `Correct.lean` with no `sorry` and no added axioms, except for the 
accepted trusted base below.

```lean

You are given a working directory, which is named after the contract
(`<Name>/`) and includes:

- The EVM bytecode (file `Bytecode.lean`).

- The source it was compiled from (e.g., `<Name>.sol`), plus the exact
  compiler and options used to produce it. The bytecode can be of
  arbitrary provenance — do not assume a specific compiler or
  version. Always check.

- The Solm specification of the contract, including its storage
  layout. (file `Spec.lean`)

- A correctness file stating the top-level theorem with a `sorry`
  placeholder. (file `Correct.lean`)

The top-level theorem is the contract refinement

```lean
contractRefinement <config> <initcode> <contract>
```

which, for a contract without immutables, is assembled with `contractRefinement.of_constant` from
the correctness of the constructor (it returns one runtime bytecode):

```lean
typedConstructorRefinement <config> <initcode> <contract> (fun _ => <runtimeBytecode>)
```

and the correctness of the runtime code:

```lean
runtimeRefinement <config> <runtimeBytecode> <contract>
```

It has no `I.perm = true` precondition, so it also covers calls entered
with STATICCALL: at a path's first SSTORE / LOG / value-carrying CALL
both sides halt with a static-mode violation (see
`Misc/Template/Function.lean`).

For a contract with immutables, the deployed runtime depends on the values the constructor sets,
and the theorem is assembled with `contractRefinement.of_runtime` instead (Section 7).

Your goal is to complete the proof. The proof must be correct,
modular, fast enough to work on, and axiom-clean except for the
accepted trusted base below.

Be forthcoming with blocking issues. Never bypass a problem to move on
to the next proof, and never circumvent it. If you suspect something
is unprovable, investigate thoroughly, report it immediately to the
user, and do not continue until it is resolved.

You should only work in the `<Name>/` directory. Do not make changes
outside of it.

## 1. Overall Workflow

### Phase 0: Evaluate the spec and bytecode

Do a thorough read of the Solm spec and the bytecode. Check that the
Solm spec matches the bytecode's storage reads/writes, arithmetic, and
control flow. If you find a mismatch, report it immediately. After
this pass, you should be confident that the Solm spec is a faithful
model of the bytecode, and that it is possible to prove the
refinement.

Things to watch for:

- The Solm spec, in general, must model storage reads/writes in the
  order the bytecode performs them. This is not a hard rule, for all
  data types. But for mapping, array, string and byte types this is
  important as otherwise you will have to introduce a slot noncollision
  axiom to prove the refinement, which is not allowed.

  If you find that you need such an axiom, evaluate whether the Solm can 
  be written 
  differently to exactly model the bytecode's storage reads/writes. 
  If it can, rewrite the Solm spec to do so.
  
  Only add such axiom if the compiler has done an optimization that cannot 
  be reflected in the Solm spec and the proof cannot be completed without it.

- The Solm spec must use helper functions where possible and not
  inline the same logic in multiple places. This is important for
  modularity and reusability of proofs.

- The storage layout in the Solm spec must match the storage layout in
  the bytecode. If there is a mismatch, report it immediately.

### Phase 1: Scaffold the proof

Create the top-level scaffold of the proof in `Correct.lean`. This
includes the dispatch skeleton, the per-function `…BodyCore` lemmas,
and the revert paths. The top-level theorem should type-check and
route correctly before the leaves are done. Reuse the available
machinery drivers for dispatching (e.g., `solcDispatchReachBody`).

1. Add the dispatch handler to the main theorem first. Wire the full
   dispatcher (`by_cases` on `callvalue`/`size`/each selector, routing
   each selector to its per-function `…BodyCore`, plus the shared
   revert paths). This skeleton should type-check and route correctly
   before the leaves are done. Add the necessary ABI selector theorem
   to `Selectors.lean` using `decide +kernel`.

2. For each ABI function `<Fn>`, route to a `…BodyCore` whose proof is
   a `sorry`. That `…BodyCore` should be defined in that function's
   own file `<Fn>.lean`.

3. Create a `…BodyCore` lemma for the constructor in
   `Constructor.lean` file.

4. The skeleton of the proof should now route every function and the
   constructor correctly through the main top-level dispatch.

*Hard rule*: You should set up the dispatch skeleton and the per ABI 
function theorems (initially with `sorry`) in their own files before 
proving any of the functions. 

It is likely that some of the `Examples/` proof templates will be useful 
for this phase. You can use them as a reference for the ABI dispatch skeleton.

### Phase 2: Prove each function

Finish each function's `…BodyCore` lemma in its own `<Fn>.lean`
file. If the proof gets difficult, do not try to bypass the problem
and move to another function. Investigate thoroughly and report
immediately any blocking issues you may find.

You should tackle proofs in order of dependency: if function `f` calls
function `g`, prove `g` first, then `f`. This is true for both
internal and external calls.

The proof of each function follows, roughly, four phases:


1. ABI decode. Prove decode succeeds for valid calldata and fails on
   each malformed branch (short / huge / non-canonical address
   lemmas). Use the `decodeCalldata_*` library lemmas
   (`decodeCalldata_address_ok`, `decodeCalldata_uint256_ok`,
   `…_none_short`, `…_none_huge`, `…_none_noncanon`). One `simpa …
   using <lib lemma>` per branch (see `BalanceOf.lean`).

2. Add selector theorems for the public selectors in `Selectors.lean`.
   Keep any canonical-signature normalization lemma private or inline; expose only the selector
   theorem unless another proof genuinely reuses the signature equality.

3. Solm source body. Prove the `ExecTransitionBody` result (return
   value / storage update / revert) using `Reasoning.SolmBody`
   (`ExecStmt`/`ExecBlock` combinators, `evalExpr_*`, `requireStep`,
   `returns`). For mutating functions, split success and revert
   branches early.

4. EVM reachability. Thread the bytecode trace from the body entry PC
   to `RDret` (success) or `RDrev` (revert). Advance with whichever
   proved lemma covers the next segment: a library `RD.*` lemma where
   one exists (solc prologue and guards, dispatch, ABI decode/encode,
   mapping hashes, external calls, …), otherwise the provided block
   summaries (Section 9) and the routine lemmas you build from them.
   Write single opcode steps (`evm_run … with [ … ]`) only where
   neither applies. Use one named `have` per block or routine; never
   one giant chain.

5. Connect. `reEquivExecution` / `reEquivDecodingFailed` /
   `reEquivNoDispatch` / `reEquivElim` glue the source result, the
   decode fact, and the EVM `RDret`/`RDrev` into
   `runtimeRefinementFor`; `RDstatic.reEquivStaticHalt` does the same
   for a static-mode halt.

---

### Phase 3: Prove the constructor

In a similar manner, prove correct the constructor body, threading the
initcode trace with the creation summaries (Section 9).

---

### Phase 4: Finish the proof

After you have proved all the functions and the constructor, verify
that the top-level theorem complies with no added axioms and no
`sorry`/`admit`. Report the axiom footprint.

---

## 2. Accepted axioms

The only acceptable trusted facts are:

- Concrete facts proved with `native_decide`, whose evaluation axiom trusts the
  compiled evaluator. Prefer `decide +kernel` when practical; selector facts
  must use kernel evaluation.

- Standard Lean axioms such as `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` when
  introduced by the proof infrastructure.

Selector identities, `keccak_size`, and EVMLean's precompile return-data bounds are proved
theorems.

If the user explicitly authorizes a contract-specific assumption that cannot be derived from
EVMLean, the concrete artifact, or kernel evaluation, create `Trusted.lean` to isolate it. Record
the assumption and its justification there, and import it only in modules that use it.

Do not introduce new axioms about EVM semantics, Solm semantics, or
mapping-slot noncollision. If you think you need one, stop, report the
situation, and ask for guidance.

---

## 3. File layout

You should work exclusively in a directory `<Name>/` for the contract
you are proving.  The file structure is the following:

The proof of a contract `<Name>` goes in a directory `<Name>/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `<Name>.sol` | the Solidity source + the exact compiler invocation used. |
| `Spec.lean` | the Solm `ContractDecl`, storage layout, `Config`. |
| `Bytecode.lean` | runtime bytecode + verified jump destinations. |
| `Selectors.lean` | selector table, `selIs`/`selWord`, and ABI selector theorems. |
| `Trusted.lean` (when required) | explicitly authorized contract-specific assumptions. |
| `Common.lean` | single proof import point plus contract-specific helpers shared by ≥2 proof files. |
| `Storage.lean` | contract-wide storage load/store + RBMap preservation + bool-return facts (only if it has storage). |
| `<Fn>.lean` | one file per interface (public/external) function — its decode, source body, EVM trace, and `…BodyCore` refinement. |
| `Constructor.lean` | the equivalence proof of the contract's constructor. |
| `RuntimeBlocks_NNN.lean` | provided: proved `RD` summaries of the runtime blocks (sharded). Never edit. |
| `CreationBlocks_NNN.lean` | provided: proved `RD` summaries of the initcode blocks (sharded). Never edit. |
| `Immutables.lean` (with immutables) | the solc `immutableReferences` table and the immutables valuation. |
| `ImmutableCode.lean` (with immutables) | the `Layout` of the runtime template's immutable sites. |
| `Correct.lean` | thin top-level: dispatcher driver + per-function routing + revert paths + constructor packaging + the final `theorem <name>Correct`. |


- At least one file per external ABI function. Never put two ABI
  functions' proofs in one file, never fold a function's body proof
  into `Correct.lean` or `Common.lean`, and never let `Correct.lean`
  carry body-specific complexity.

- Shared machinery used by several functions goes in
  `Common.lean`/`Storage.lean`/`Routines.lean`, not in any one
  function's file. Internal/private functions are not ABI
  entries. Their proofs can go into common files or their own
  standalone files.

- You can add further helper files in `<Name>/` for common lemmas and
  helpers.

- **Hard rule:** do not let files grow past 2000 lines. If this
  happens you should split them into smaller files by concern.
  This is important for build speed. 
  You can exceptionally create files larger that 2000 lines 
  ONLY IF ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE.

---

## 4. Reasoning library and reuse

`Reasoning/` is a library of abstractions, lemmas, and tactics for
proving EVM bytecode correct against its Solm spec. Useful reads:

- `Reasoning/GUIDE.md` — the library map: where every kind of fact
  lives, import layering, and the gotchas (native_decide for decode,
  `RD.foo rd` not `rd.foo`, heartbeat budgets, etc.).

- Each `Reasoning/*.lean` file's `/-! # … -/` header — per-module
  detail.

How to use the library:

- Respect and extend the library's abstractions. Almost every line should apply a library lemma.
  A reusable, contract-independent fact the library lacks is a missing library lemma. Add it
  (proved) to the current working directory's `Common.lean` (or another local common file), 
  tagged `-- LIBRARY CANDIDATE: <generalizes…>`
  (or `-- GENERALIZES Reasoning.<Module>.<lemma> …` for a near-variant). 

- Never edit `Reasoning/` yourself

- Do not reinvent. The library already discharges the solc prologue,
  non-payable guard, calldata-size guard, selector load,
  `RD.dispatchTo` selector routing, ABI decode/encode, memory/storage
  round-trips, and the `RD`/`RDret`/`RDrev` stepping
  discipline. Almost every line you write should be applying a library
  lemma, not proving EVM semantics from scratch. Before writing any
  arithmetic / calldata / memory / dispatch proof by hand, search for
  an existing lemma.

- Never duplicate lemmas and proof work. Always search `Reasoning/`
  for existing lemmas before proving a new one.  If you find yourself
  proving the same fact in two places, refactor it into a single lemma
  in a common file.

- You should strive to build generic, modular, and reusable
  infrastructure in your proofs and follow the library abstractions.
  This will make your proofs more maintainable and easier to
  understand.

- After you are done with your proof, someone will evaluate it for
  generality and reusability.  If your lemmas are deemed general
  enough, they will promote your lemmas to the `Reasoning/` library.
  If they find that your lemmas are too specific, they will ask you to
  refactor them into more generic lemmas that can be reused in other
  proofs.

- Lemma hygiene:

  1. Make lemmas useful and general. The new lemmas that you add
     should be as generic as possible, avoiding hard-coded PCs,
     widths, types, and stack tails when possible.

  2. Do not prove anticipated lemmas, unless you are 100% sure they
     will be used in the final proof.

  3. Before introducing a lemma, search `Reasoning/` and the existing
     examples for one that already exists — do not re-prove it.

  4. Never duplicate a lemma. If you find yourself writing the same
     lemma in two places, refactor it into a single lemma in a common
     file. If you find yourself proving similar lemmas in two places,
     consider generalizing the lemma to make it reusable.

  5. Add lemmas in the working directory (shared ones in common
     files), then flag the contract-independent ones for promotion to
     `Reasoning/` (below). Do not add lemmas directly to `Reasoning/`.

- The library is not yet exercised by every Solidity construct. As you
  prove new patterns you will find segments that are
  contract-independent and reusable and can be promoted to the
  library.  When you do:

  1. Make sure the theorem is not already proved in `Reasoning/`. Search first.

  2. If your lemma is a near-miss of an existing one (same shape,
    different PC/width/type/stack tail), that is a generalization
    opportunity: write your version in the common file and mark it `--
    GENERALIZES Reasoning.<Module>.<lemma> — lift by parameterizing
    over <what differs>`, so the library lemma can later be widened to
    subsume both instead of accreting near-duplicates.

  3. If it's genuinely new but contract-independent, mark it a fresh
     `LIBRARY CANDIDATE`.  The goal: every reusable fact ends up in
     one place, tagged with where it belongs in `Reasoning/`, so
     lifting it later is a mechanical move, not a hunt across function
     files.

  4. Collect all candidates in common files per example so the lift is
     mechanical, not a scavenger hunt.

  5. A lemma is library-ready only if it references no example-local
     defs. Watch for per-example abbreviations (`addr`, `uint256`,
     `uint256Int` are redefined in each `Spec.lean`); inline the raw
     type or it won't compile in the library.


---

## 5. Examples

The `Examples/` directory contains a set of template proofs. You can
use them as a reference for your own proof.

Look at the examples to find known patterns and proof templates for 
your proof.

Note that not all examples are derived with the same compiler,
version, and optimization settings. Always check the source and
bytecode for your contract.

The examples may lag behind recent Solm changes (they are migrated in
batches). If an example does not compile, use it as a *reading*
reference for trace/dispatch/proof patterns only — do not build it and
do not copy its conventions blindly. In particular, examples written
before the multi-value-return change show the old return conventions
(`returnType := some T` / `.return e`); the current convention is
lists (`returnType := [T]` / `.return [e]`, multi-value
`.return [a, b]`).

- For an example of binary search dispatch, see `Examples/Ballot`. 
- For an example of linear dispatch, see `Examples/ERC20`.


*Hard rule:* do not import code directly from `Examples/` into your proof. 
If you find yourself needed the same lemma, prove it in your own working 
directory and flag it for promotion to the library if it is general enough.

---

## 6. Function Calls and loops

Function calls should be proven modularly. In particular:

- External calls (calls to other contracts):

  All external calls are proved correct by showing the bytecode and
  the source semantics make to the same opaque Ethereum.EVM.Θ
  invocation. The generated summaries do not cover the call
  instruction itself (`CALL`, `STATICCALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CREATE*`):
  they stop before it, and the next summary resumes at the following
  pc from a fresh symbolic state. Step over the call with the
  library's RD call lemmas (`RD.call`, `RD.callValueMade`,
  `RD.solcStaticcall`, their `…DepthLimit`/`…InsufficientBalance`
  siblings, …), which produce the Θ witness, then continue with the
  summary that resumes after the call. That witness is what you carry
  over to the Solm side: calldata/target
  lemmas prove the bytecode memory slice matches the source ABI call;
  then callCoincides or direct callViaEVM.callMade turns that into the
  source-side call relation, with account-map transport handled by
  typedCallViaEVM_accountMapEquiv or callViaEVM_accountMapEquiv.

  For static external calls, you may also use the proved fact that the
  accounts storage is preserved by the call.

- Internal calls:

  For internal calls, never inline the caller proof manually. Prove
  the callee body once as an ExecFuncBody, then use
  internalCallFunctionReturn or internalCallFunctionRevert to
  discharge the caller’s .internalCall statement by supplying argument
  evaluation, function lookup, parameter binding, and the callee body
  proof.

  This is also true when a public function is also called internally
  by another function of the contract. The callee body is proved once,
  and the caller uses the callee’s lemma to discharge its internal
  call.

  Reference: `Examples/Reuse`; larger patterns occur in Ballot and
  BlindAuction.

  If a function `f` is called internally by another function `g`,
  prove `f` before tackling the proof of `g`.


- Loops: 

  The `Examples/BlindAuction` example has a big complicated loop in the 
  `Reveal` function and shows how to prove loops by induction: state
  the invariant over the loop counter, prove a single reusable
  body-step lemma, and close the loop by induction on the remaining
  iterations, on both the Solm side and the bytecode trace.
---

## 7. Immutables

Follow `Examples/TinyImmutable`. Do not copy the Dog/Clipper style (a
`patchRuntime … = some code` hypothesis, hand-transported decodes, valuations holding `Value`s):
those proofs were migrated mechanically and predate this approach.

The top-level theorem is

```lean
theorem <name>ContractCorrect : contractRefinement config <initcode> contract :=
  .of_runtime <name>ConstructorCorrect <name>RuntimeCorrect
```

(`contractRefinementWF <wf> …` with a storage precondition), with
`runtimeCodeOf := immutableLayout.deployed <template>` from `Reasoning/Immutables.lean`: the
template with every immutable site patched with `wordsOf imms`, each immutable's word under Solm's
`valueToWord`. Never define a contract-specific `runtimeCodeOf`, word map, or patch function.

**Layout.**
- `Immutables.lean`: `immutableReferences : List (Ident × List Nat)`, each immutable's Solm name
  and its offsets copied verbatim from solc's `evm.deployedBytecode.immutableReferences`, listed
  in the order the constructor writes them; and a valuation `structure <Name>Immutables` with
  EVM-level fields (`EVM.Address`, `EVM.Word`, …), used by the runtime proofs.
- `ImmutableCode.lean`: `immutableLayout : Layout`, derived from the table (width 32, key = the
  Solm name).
- `Common.lean`: `immStore v : Store`; `@[simp] wordsOf_immStore_<x>` for each immutable (via
  `wordsOf_of_get`); `deployedRuntime v := immutableLayout.deployed <template> (immStore v)`;
  `evalImmutable_<x>`; `immutableLayout_keys` (every site key is a declared immutable, by
  `decide`); and `restrictImmutables_of_fit : immutablesFit contract imms →
  ∃ v, restrictImmutables contract imms = immStore v`.

**Runtime.**
1. Prove the runtime for every valuation: `<name>Correct (v) : runtimeRefinement config
   (deployedRuntime v) contract (immStore v)`. Never fix immutable values, and never take the code
   as a parameter.
2. Use the runtime summaries (Section 9); they are stated over the template patched by the
   layout. Every summary quantifies `immWords`; instantiate `immWords := wordsOf (immStore v)`,
   and an immutable site pushes `wordsOf (immStore v) "<x>"`, which `wordsOf_immStore_<x>`
   rewrites to its value (it does not reduce definitionally, so `rw` it before a `change`).
   Compose the summaries into dispatch, body and revert paths (see
   `Examples/TinyImmutable/BlocksProof.lean`: `tinyBlocksReachSelector`, `tinyOwnerX`). Never
   reprove that the patched code decodes like the template.
3. Jump destinations: the summaries need `(D_J (deployedRuntime v) 0).contains pc`. The patched
   runtime has the template's jump destinations, since the `D_J` scan skips push payloads:
   `D_J (deployedRuntime v) 0 = D_J <template> 0 := Layout.D_J_runtime (by native_decide)
   (by native_decide)` (see `tinyPatchedValidJumps`). Rewrite with it, and each jump
   destination is a `native_decide` on the template.
4. Bridge, in `Correct.lean`:
   ```lean
   theorem <name>RuntimeCorrect (imms : Store) (hfit : immutablesFit contract imms) :
       runtimeRefinement config (immutableLayout.deployed <template> imms) contract
         (restrictImmutables contract imms) := by
     obtain ⟨v, hv⟩ := restrictImmutables_of_fit hfit
     rw [← Reasoning.Immutables.Layout.deployed_restrict immutableLayout_keys, hv]
     exact <name>Correct v
   ```

**Constructor** (`typedConstructorRefinement config <initcode> contract
(immutableLayout.deployed <template>)`).
1. Deployment shape: `config.selfDeployment <initcode> args = some d → ∃ <typed args>,
   args = [...] ∧ <range facts> ∧ d = <initcode> ++ <encoded args>`.
2. The final immutables of each source path, built from `initialImmutables contract` by `insert`
   (an immutable a path does not assign keeps its zero value), with `get?` lemmas. The Solm body
   assigns them with `ExecStmt.setImmutable` (value, declared type, `elemValueFits`).
3. The EVM trace, chained from the creation summaries, ends in `RDret … (deployedRuntime {…})`:
   the template `CODECOPY` puts the template
   in memory, each patch `MSTORE` is a `writeWord`, and together they form a `writeCascade`. Prove
   the cascade `= deployedRuntime {…}` by unfolding `Layout.deployed`/`Layout.runtime`/
   `Layout.writes` with the `wordsOf_immStore_<x>` lemmas (`tinyCtorPatchedRuntime_eq_deployedRuntime`);
   listing the table in write order keeps this a `rfl`.
4. Tie the final immutables to that code: two stores deploy the same code when they agree on each
   immutable's word (`deployed_eq_deployedRuntime`, by `Layout.runtime_congr` and
   `immutableLayout_keys`); per path, `wordsOf_of_get (<…>_get_<x> …) rfl` gives each word.
5. Close each success case with
   `.execution hΞ hsolm (ctorResultEquiv.success rfl rfl rfl (<deployed lemma>).symm) (<…>_fit …)`,
   and each revert with `.execution hΞ hsolm (ctorResultEquiv.revert rfl rfl) trivial`.

---

## 8. Build discipline, tactics, proof engineering, efficiency

- Every file should compile and should be validated by the build
  system.

- Builds are slow. Only recompile when necessary. Do not make
  pointless recompilation attempts.

- Quick elaboration is important. Prefer `simp only` over `simp`, and
  `native_decide` over `decide`. Avoid tactics that blow up build
  time.

- Don't rebuild the world to check a leaf lemma.

- If your proof is taking too long to compile, you should evaluate
  your tactics and see if you can optimize them.  You may also
  consider splitting the proof into smaller lemmas to improve
  compilation time.

- Develop new lemmas in a small scratch file, not by editing the large
  file in place. Heavy files take minutes to rebuild and every edit
  re-elaborates the whole file. Create a throwaway
  `<Name>/Scratch.lean` in your working directory that imports the real file (so its
  defs/lemmas are in scope, compiled once and cached) and develop the
  new lemma there with fast cycles. Once it compiles clean, move it
  into its proper file and delete the scratch.

- Decode obligations use `native_decide`, not `decide` (~20× faster on
  big bytecode). The generated summaries discharge their own; in hand
  steps, `evm_run` cooked steps auto-supply it; raw steps
  write `(by native_decide)` for decode, `(by decide)` for small side
  conditions, `(by jump_dest)` for jump-dest membership, `(by evm_ov)`
  for stack-overflow bounds. Keep these — the resulting `native_decide`
  axiom dependencies (`….native_decide.ax_*`) are expected and fine.

- Raise `maxHeartbeats` only on the file/lemma that needs it, with
  `set_option … in` on that one theorem, not globally.

---

## 9. Block summaries and routine lemmas

**Advance the bytecode with proved lemmas, not hand-written traces.** Two sources are
available, and they combine freely in one trace: the `Reasoning/` library's `RD.*` lemmas,
which cover standard solc segments in one step (prefer them where they apply; Section 4), and
the block summaries provided with your working directory, proved `RD` summaries of every basic
block, generated from the bytecode. There are two sets of summaries, each split into shards of
at most 20.

- **Runtime summaries** (`RuntimeBlocks_NNN.lean`) run over the deployed
  runtime bytecode; for a contract with immutables, over the patched template
  `layout.runtime template immWords` with `immWords` quantified (Section 7). Use them for the
  dispatcher, every runtime function, and the shared revert paths.
- **Creation summaries** (`CreationBlocks_NNN.lean`) run over
  `initcode ++ tail` for an arbitrary `tail`, the ABI-encoded constructor arguments: every
  summary quantifies `tail`, and decodes and jump destinations come from the fixed initcode
  prefix. Instantiate `tail` with the deployment's encoded arguments (from the
  deployment-shape lemma) and use them for the constructor trace: the prologue, argument
  decoding, the constructor body, and the final runtime copy and `RETURN`.

Never edit or regenerate the summaries. If one is missing, fails to build, or looks wrong, stop
and report it. (`Examples/TinyImmutable` has a single unsharded runtime file, `BlocksAuto.lean`,
only because its bytecode is tiny, and its constructor trace predates the creation summaries.)

- **Summary shape.** `<name>_block_<pc>` runs one block from `pc` over an arbitrary stack tail
  `R`, to the next block's pc, `RDret`, or `RDrev`. A block ending in `JUMPI` gives
  `…_taken` and `…_fallthrough`, each with the branch condition as a hypothesis. `…_packed`
  siblings make the final step/gas counters and active words existential; blocks with warm/cold
  accesses always do. The resulting stack (and memory, when the block writes it) is a named
  definition, `…_stack`/`…_memory`, unfolded with `simp`/`simpa`. An opcode's side conditions
  (stack bounds, jump-destination validity `(D_J code 0).contains pc`, the branch condition,
  arithmetic facts) are hypotheses of the summary, so the chain is: discharge the hypotheses,
  apply, move on.
- **Unsupported instructions.** The generator marks each instruction it cannot summarize with
  a comment `Unsupported instruction boundary at pc N: <op>`. External calls are the main case
  (Section 6); a few rarer opcodes are too. Step over the instruction with the library's
  `RD.*` lemma for it (or an `evm_run … with [ … ]` raw step), then continue with the summary
  that starts at the next pc.

**Compose summaries into routine lemmas.** Every repeated bytecode segment becomes one
`RD`-combinator lemma, proved once from the summaries, applied many times:

- A segment `pc_in → pc_out` over a stack tail `R` becomes a theorem of the form
  `RD code … pc_in (args ++ R) … → ∃ k' C', RD code … pc_out (results ++ R) …` (or `→ RDret` /
  `→ RDrev` for terminal segments). Existing examples: `RD.routine9c`, `RD.routinebb`,
  `RD.routinecf`, `RD.erc20DecodeAddrMask`, `RD.erc20MappingHashSuffix`,
  `RD.erc20RoutineEncodeUint256`; summary composition: `Examples/TinyImmutable/BlocksProof.lean`.

- These chain directly: `rd |>.routineA … |>.routineB …` (call as `RD.foo rd …`, not
  `rd.foo` — the `RD` type whnf's to an `Or`). Factor over a generic tail `R` so the lemma is
  reused at every call site regardless of what else is on the stack.

- Before writing a trace, scan the bytecode for segments solc shares (decoders, the address
  mask/cleanup, the mapping-hash `keccak` suffix, the uint256 ABI encoder, identity
  `cleanup_t_*` routines). solc emits these once; prove them once. If you find yourself
  chaining the same summaries in two functions, stop and extract a lemma.

- Generalize hard-coded constants (PCs, widths, types, stack tails) into lemma parameters
  wherever possible, so the lemma is reusable across functions. If a lemma is truly
  contract-independent, flag it for promotion to `Reasoning/`.

- Split traces into `have`s, one per block or routine. A long chain over a compound tail blows
  the heartbeat/`whnf` budget. Factoring a routine over a generic tail `R` may need
  `set_option maxHeartbeats 1000000 in` and intermediate `have`s — see
  `RD.erc20DecodeAddrMask`.

Never guess PCs, opcodes, jump destinations, or stack shapes. They are a pure function of the
bytecode and the summaries already encode them: read entry PCs from the summary name, exit PCs
from the conclusion, and stack shapes from the `…_stack` definitions. For any hand step, disassemble
`Bytecode.lean` (a short script, `evmasm`/`solc --asm`, or by decoding the byte array) and treat the
step as "fill in the side conditions of a known opcode," not "invent the opcode." When a step fails,
re-check it against the disassembly first.

## 10. Hard rules

- Do not make changes outside of your working directory.

- Do not build examples and benchmarks that are not your own. 
  **This is extremely important**. Builds are extremely expensive and time-consuming.
  Only build your own working directory. 

- If you find misspecifications, mismatches, or unprovable
  obligations, stop and report them immediately. Do not continue until
  they are resolved.

- Edit `Spec.lean` only if you are certain it is wrong, and report the
  change immediately. Do not change the given bytecode or Solidity
  source.

- Never edit `Bytecode.lean`. If you suspect it is wrong, report it
  immediately.

- No `sorry` in the finished proof.

- Treat a suspected need for a new `axiom` as a blocker. Report it and ask for guidance;
  follow the authorized-assumption policy in Section 2 only after explicit approval.

## 11. Finish checklist

Run, and report results verbatim:

```
lake build <Module>.Correct
rg -n '\b(sorry|admit)\b' <WorkDir>
rg -n '^axiom ' <WorkDir>
printf '%s\n' 'import <Module>.Correct' '#print axioms <Namespace>.<name>Correct' | lake env lean --stdin
```

where `<WorkDir>` is your working directory, `<Module>` its Lean module
path, and `<Namespace>` the contract's namespace — e.g. for
`Examples/ERC20/`: `Examples.ERC20`; for `Benchmarks/Dss/Dai/`:
`Benchmarks.Dss.Dai`.

The build must succeed with no `sorry`.

Any project-authored `axiom` reported by the search must satisfy the authorized-assumption policy
in Section 2 and be visible in the capstone audit when used.

The axiom footprint should contain only
`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` and documented `native_decide`
evaluation axioms (`….native_decide.ax_*`) used for concrete proof obligations.
Selector identities, `keccak_size`, `ByteArray_zeroes_size`,
`Theta_returnData_size_lt_2pow138`, and `typedCallViaEVM_accountMapEquiv`
are proved theorems and do not appear as custom axioms. Flag anything
beyond this set as a new axiom introduced by the proof.
